# 🖤 NeoBrutalism — phpMyAdmin Theme

> **Bold. Raw. Unapologetic.** A neobrutalist design theme for phpMyAdmin that throws away the boring and brings in the brutal.

---

## 🎨 About the Theme

**NeoBrutalism** is a custom phpMyAdmin theme inspired by the modern **Neo-Brutalist** design movement — a style that embraces raw aesthetics, thick borders, flat colors, and hard drop shadows to create an interface that *commands attention*.

Forget soft gradients and rounded corners. This theme is all about:

- 🟨 **Flat, vibrant accent colors** — No gradients. Just pure, punchy hues.
- ⬛ **Bold black borders** — Every element is clearly defined with thick, uncompromising outlines.
- 🟦 **Hard drop shadows** — Offset shadows that give a stacked, tangible feel.
- 🔤 **Strong typography** — Chunky fonts with high contrast for maximum readability.
- 📐 **Sharp edges everywhere** — Zero border-radius. Brutal by design.

## 🎭 Design Philosophy

Neo-Brutalism in web design is a reaction to the over-polished, overly minimal interfaces of the modern web. It takes cues from **Brutalist architecture** — raw, exposed, functional — and blends it with playful colors and purposeful layout.

Key principles of this theme:

- 💪 **Strength over subtlety** — UI elements are bold and immediately readable
- 🚫 **No decorative fluff** — Every element serves a purpose
- 🖤 **Contrast is king** — Dark backgrounds, light text, vibrant accents
- 📏 **Structure is visible** — Borders and shadows define every boundary
